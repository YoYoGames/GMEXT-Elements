 * @desc This GameMaker extension brings the full power of the **Namazu Elements Core API** directly into your GameMaker projects—turning what's normally a heavy backend integration into a clean set of GML-friendly functions. Instead of spending weeks building authentication, player profiles, cloud saves, inventory, leaderboards, matchmaking, missions, and live notifications from scratch, you can plug in a proven backend and start shipping features immediately. It's ideal for studios that want modern online functionality (and the ability to scale it) without becoming a backend engineering team—while still keeping control of gameplay logic inside GameMaker and letting Elements handle the infrastructure. 
 * 
 * ## Extension's Features
 * 
 * * **GameMaker-native wrapper:** Simple GML calls that map to Elements endpoints—no wrestling with raw REST requests. 
 * * **Player identity & sessions:** OAuth2/OIDC-based login/session flows made engine-friendly. 
 * * **Core live-game backend modules:** Profiles/users, cloud save data, items/inventory, missions/progress/rewards, and metadata/specs. 
 * * **Competitive & social systems:** Leaderboards/ranks/scores plus followers/friends-style social graph features. 
 * * **Matchmaking & matches:** Services to support online play loops and session-based gameplay. 
 * * **Live ops hooks:** Notifications/schedules and health/version endpoints for operating and updating your game more safely. 
 * * **Commerce support:** Receipt validation flows (e.g., Apple IAP) to connect purchases to in-game rewards. 
 * * **Optional advanced capabilities:** "Omni" modules for wallets/vaults/smart contracts if your project needs multi-chain features. 
 * 
 * If you want, paste your extension's actual selling points (async pattern, caching, retries, error handling, example projects, supported platforms like desktop/mobile/HTML5), and I'll rewrite this into a tighter "launch post" with a punchy headline + feature sections + CTA.
